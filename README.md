# PDA-Project-
Programming for Data Analytics Project Sept-Dec 2019

### Project Intoduction:

This project involves the creation of a data set by simulating a real-world phenomenon. A phenomenon of my choose is selected and  rather than collect data related to this phenomenon, I will model and synthesise the data using Python. The numpy.random package will be used to help achieve these tasks . 

### Project Plan/Objectives:

• Choose a real-world phenomenon that can be measured and for which you could collect at least one-hundred data points across at least four diﬀerent variables.

• Investigate the types of variables involved, their likely distributions, and their relationships with each other. 

• Synthesise/simulate a data set as closely matching their properties as possible. 

• Detail your research and implement the simulation in a Jupyter notebook – the data set itself can simply be displayed in an output cell within the notebook. 

### Repository Contents

- README
- ipynb file
- gitignore
- licence

### Software Used / Download Instructions / How to access my repository

_Instructions on how to download_:

Download and install the following programs:Anaconda, Visual Studio Code and CMDER command line. They will enable you to view and run the programs/code in the repository.

Go to my repository on GitHub, once the repository is open click on the clone/download icon. Select a location on your machine to save the download.

_Instructions to Run_:

Open Cmder or Anaconda.

Navigate to the directory/location where you have saved/unzipped my repository.

In CMDER once you've navigated to the folder location then type "jupyter notebook" followed by "enter". This will open a new browser tab displaying a list of files (ie. repository contents: README/ipynb etc.).

If you click into the "PDA Project.ipynb", this file contains the bulk of the assignment.

If you want to run or re-run any code in the .ipynb file just click into the relevant cell and hold down "Shift" and "Enter" together.
